### About This Project 

ASOMA human resources application has four different roles: admin, company manager, employee and guest. Each role is equipped with its own dashboard, profile and pages designed according to their tasks.

When a company manager registers, their registration is approved by the admin. Once approved, the company manager gains access to the system and can then add employees to the system. He can manage all transactions related to employees through this panel. For company managers, there is a special page with detailed information about their company's financial status such as income, expenses and profit and loss.

The employee profile includes personal information, salary details and shift schedules. The employee dashboard also provides general vacation information and details about the company they work for. Employees can make comments about their company, but these comments are only published after admin approval.

Guests who register on the app can access information about all the companies registered on the app and their comments.
